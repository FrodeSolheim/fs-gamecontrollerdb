# Linux

On Linux, only one controller can be inserted into the adapter at a time.
Linux only sees two axes and one button.  The controller can be used with
either port in the cable.

There are some projects to fix support for this adapter:

* https://github.com/robmcmullen/hid-atari-retrobit
* https://github.com/msteinbeck/hid-retrobit

Maybe the Linux HID module should get a patch with HID_QUIRK_MULTI_INPUT.

# macos

On macOS, there are four axes and two buttons, but the ports are merged into
one device, so only port 1 of the cable is mapped.

# Windows

Works out of the box with two controllers connected (the adapter appears as two
joystick devices).
